To learn Higher order Functions:

Different ways of implementing the following:
1. Sum of Cubes of all numbers between 1 and 4
2. Sum of factorials of all consecutive numbers between given numbers 1 and 4
3. Product of cubes of all consecutive numbers between 1 and 4
4. Assert/Test to verify if the results obtained for sum of factorials is same from different implementations
